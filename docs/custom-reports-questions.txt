VARIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT CUSTOM REPORTS

1)  If a customer retrieves a saved report that store "STORE_XYZ" selected, but that store is no longer available, what should we do?
    Possible solutions would be:
    - just ignore it
    - warn the user that their custom report had original STORE_XYZ selected but that is no longer available

2)  If a customer retrieves a saved report that has segments "SEG_XYZ" selected, but that segment is no longer available, what should we do?
    Possible solutions would be:
    - just ignore it
    - warn the user that their custom report had original SEG_XYZ selected but that is no longer available
